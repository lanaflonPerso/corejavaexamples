A collection is an object that is composed of elements --> elements can be either primitive or references to objects.

Array:
	collection of elements
	same type, and both primitive and reference/object type elements
	stored contiguous in memory
	random access
	
	Array name stores a reference to the beginning of the space allocated.
	
	drawbacks:
		fixed size
		space must be allocated before any elements stored
		insertions/deletions not possible or involve lot of code
		
Collection classes:

Collection classes can only handle reference types. [This is why we got autoboxing/unboxing concept for primitive types]

	Each instance of a collection class is a collection of elements.
	Each element is an object.
	

Storage structures for Collection classes:

	Contiguous-collection class: 	ArrayList
	
	Linked-collection class : LinkedList (Single-linkedlist, double-linkedlist)
	

Java colleciton framework has few abstract classes:
	
		AbstractCollection
		AbstractList
		AbstractSet
		

The Java Collection Framework:

	Top of the hierarchy : 2 interfaces -> Collection and Map
